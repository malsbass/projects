F1 score. Based on this score, the best model would be the LR with elasticnet penalty. Also, since the consequences of misclassifying a high risk patient would be inacceptable, we favor a model with a higher recall for stroke risk, confirming the choice of the LR model.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"Uo5GMRTZvcho"}}]}
